# Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation in MATLAB (YOLOv2 + ResNet50 + SAM)

This project implements a hybrid deep learning system for detecting and segmenting brain tumors from MRI images using MATLAB. It integrates YOLOv2 for object detection, ResNet50 as a feature extractor, and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for advanced segmentation.

## ðŸ‘¤ Developer

- **Mertcan KankÄ±lÄ±Ã§**

##  Techniques Used

- **YOLOv2**: For real-time and accurate tumor detection.
- **ResNet50**: Backbone network to improve feature extraction in YOLOv2.
- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: Used for high-precision segmentation of detected regions.

##  Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or newer
- Required toolboxes:
  - Image Processing Toolbox
  - Deep Learning Toolbox
  - Computer Vision Toolbox

##  How to Run

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `src` folder:
   ```matlab
   cd src
   main
   ```
2. In the GUI:

##  Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
- **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN)

##  Results

The system achieved high accuracy in detecting and segmenting brain tumors. The GUI provides an integrated, user-friendly interface suitable for clinical workflows. SAM enhances post-detection segmentation precision.
